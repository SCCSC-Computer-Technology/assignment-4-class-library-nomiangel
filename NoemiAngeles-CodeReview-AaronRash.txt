Noemi Angeles code review by Aaron Rash

I see you've built a class libray that contains all your search/sort queries.
I attempted the same thing, but used a different approach.
While I used table adapters, you used linq to sql, and returned your results with IQueryable.

Using table adapters can be functional, but its a little harder to work with in my opinion
Having queries built into the code is a lot more intuitive

Linq to sql makes it easy to read/edit
Using IQueryable is concise and gives functionality
And using this as a class library will keep your main code clean & organized.

I find your approach a lot preferable to mine.

Your library is very comprehensive, while staying readable.
I consider this a success.
